# Causal-Inference--CS-582
This was a graduate level course aimed at understanding causality.

This course covers the practical tools needed for evaluating causal claims and making causal inferences. We will explore two primary questions -- 1) what is causality? 2) how can we find it? After covering the conceptual and theoretical underpinnings of causal inference, we discuss how causal inference is handled by different fields and how to responsibly test it in real-world cases.

It is taught by one of the pioneers in the field Dr.Samantha Kleinberg.
